        <h2>Saint Louis, Missouri</h2>
        <p> The Saint Louis Zoo brings visitors nose-to-nose with a swimming polar bear and offers new insights into the lives of polar bears and the Arctic people who rely on them through its new $16 million, 40,000-square-foot McDonnell Polar Bear Point exhibit that opened to the public Saturday, June 6, 2015.

          <p>The Gateway Arch is a 630-foot (192 m) monument in St. Louis in the U.S. state of Missouri. Clad in stainless steel and built in the form of an inverted, weighted catenary arch,[5] it is the world's tallest arch,[4] the tallest man-made monument in the Western Hemisphere,[6] and Missouri's tallest accessible building. Built as a monument to the westward expansion of the United States,[5] it is the centerpiece of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial and has become an internationally famous symbol of St. Louis.
The arch sits at the site of St. Louis' founding on the west bank of the Mississippi River.[</p>

          <p> During the early 1990s, about 95,000 people arrived in eastern Nepal. They claimed to have come from Bhutan, and they alleged that they had been forced out of their homelands by the Bhutanese government. Very few believed them, and even now, not a single one of these refugees has returned to Bhutan. This book explains who these people are and why they left Bhutan. It also examines the broader implications of their story for a world awash with refugees..

            style="width: 300px; height : 230px;"> <br> <p>KANYAM, Oct 22: Ilam's beauty is breathtaking even on an average day. And it grows by manifold when rain drenches the green hills of the district and dense fog starts to glide down the vast stretch of tea estates and opens them to blue sky. This is exactly the reason why Ilam is flooded with tourists these days.

“Though this is just the beginning of the tourist season, flow of tourists to our district is exciting,” said Kashi Sherpa, a hotel entrepreneur in Sandakpur, said. “Both domestic and international tourists are making their way to Ilam.”

It was heavily raining until last few days and later the town was covered by fog for many days. The fog acted as a barrier for some tourists but as soon as it started clearing out, tourists have started flocking here, she said. “As soon as the fog cleared out of the vast stretches of green tea estates and a little bit winter chill entered the town, tourists started flooding in. The arrival is so much that it's been very hard for us to cater to them.”  </p>

            <p> Jaldapara is known for its Rhino population. There are only a few areas where this elusive beauty can be found. Apart from Kaziranga and Pobitara in Assam, Jaldapara in West Bengal is being the safe home for this wonderful species since long. The grass wetland, ideal for Rhino's provides them natural habitat for their strong survival.

The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) is also called greater one-horned rhinoceros and Asian one-horned rhinoceros and belongs to the Rhinocerotidae family. Listed as a vulnerable species, the large mammal is primarily found in north-eastern India's Assam and in protected areas in the Terai of Nepal, where populations are confined to the riverine grasslands in the foothills of the Himalayas.

              style="width: 300px; height : 230px;"><br><p>The sharp decline in Red Panda population in the past has been caused by large scale hunting, trapping and trading, and disturbance, fragmentation and loss of habitat.

Despite providing sufficient protection the low Red Panda population, may be affected by genetic problems. It is in danger of becoming extinct in the wild and in fact has already become extinct in certain areas.

The Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, Darjeeling dedicated to the conservation of endangered Himalayan fauna took a serious view of the situation of this rare species by embarking upon conservation Breeding Programme.

The Zoological Park is ideally situated within the natural distribution zone of the Red Panda. There was no other captive breeding facility available in the vicinity of Red Panda (Ailurus fulgens fulgens) natural habitat.

The Zoological Park has had proper housing facilities required for Red Panda even at that time and has had earlier records of success of breeding of Red Panda in captivity</p>

              <h2 class="subject" >Deothang, Bhutan</h2>
              <p> Deothang is a town in south-eastern Bhutan. It is located in Samdrup Jongkhar District at an altitude of 870 metres (2855 feet).[1] At the 2005 census it had a population of 2,644.[2]
The town and surrounding area is known for its bird population and there is the Sonai-Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary. The Royal Bhutan Polytechnic (RBP) in Deothang provides a three-year diploma course.
The town of Deothang is only a small town today except for the Polytechnic. However, until 1865 there was an important fort standing on the ridge overlooking the road into the town. This fort, known at the time as Dewangiri, was dismantled by the British during the Anglo-Bhutanese War of 1865. The British were defeated at Deothang and when they recaptured Dewangiri they destroyed much to attempt to compensate..

                style="width: 300px; height : 230px;"> <br><p>This species has a sacculated stomach to assist in the breakdown of cellulose. The capped langur has enlarged salivary glands to assist it in breaking down food. The dental formula of the golden langur is 2:1:2:3 on both the upper and lower jaws (Ankel-Simons, 2000). The tail of this species is longer than the head and body combined (Choudhury, 1989). The head and body length of adult males ranges from 68.4-70.0 centimeters and for adult females it ranges from 59.0-67.0 centimeters (Choudhury, 1989). The tail length for adult males ranges from 94.0-104.0 centimeters and for adult females it ranges from 78.0-90.0 centimeters (Choudhury, 1989). The capped langur has a pelage color of blackish or ashy gray on the dorsal side and dull-reddish to creamy-yellow and golden-yellow on the ventral side (Choudhury, 1989). The face is deep black with the crown blackish (Choudhury, 1989). The cheeks contrast with the rest of the face and the crown in being paler with a golden-reddish tinge (Choudhury, 1989). The ears, palms, and soles, are black in coloration (Choudhury, 1989). The hindquarters and the insides of the thighs are light cobalt blue, which is more prominent in males than females (Choudhury, 1989). The distal half of the tail is blackish (Choudhury, 1989). The pelage of infants is creamy-white with a golden tinge all over (Choudhury, 1989). The face, ears, palms, and soles of the infant are pinkish, with the face having a darker tinge (Choudhury, 1989). Juvenile capped langurs are a dull creamy-white all over with a light ash tinge on the back (Choudhury, 1989). The face, ears, palms, and soles are black in juveniles, but paler than in adults (Choudhury, 1989). Males can have a body mass ranging from 11.5-14.0, and the female body mass that ranges from 9.5-11.5 kilograms (Choudhury, 1989).</p>

              <p> Drukgyal Dzong was a fortress and Buddhist monastery, now in ruins, located in the upper part of the Paro District, Bhutan. The dzong was probably built by Tenzin Drukdra in 1649 at the behest of Ngawang Namgyal, Zhabdrung Rinpoche, to commemorate victory over an invasion from Tibet.
In the early 1950s, Drukgyal Dzong was almost completely destroyed by fire. It is listed as a tentative site in Bhutan's Tentative List for UNESCO inclusion.
In 2016, to celebrate the birth of His Royal Highness The Gyalsey, as well as to commemorate two other significant events, namely, the arrival of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel to Bhutan in 1616 AD and the birth year of Guru Rinpoche, the Prime Minister Lyonchen Tshering Tobgay announced that the Dzong will be rebuilt and reinstated to its former glory. The announcement and ground breaking ceremony took place a day after the Prince was born
